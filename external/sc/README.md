Schwarz-Christoffel Toolbox for conformal mapping in MATLAB

The SC Toolbox contains numerical routines and graphical interfaces to work with Schwarz-Christoffel conformal maps--those to regions bounded by polgons in the complex plane. Many map variations are present. The software has no requirements other than core MATLAB.

For more details on the maps, see _Schwarz Christoffel Mapping_, by Driscoll and Trefethen. For a user's guide, visit https://tobydriscoll.net/project/sc-toolbox/.
